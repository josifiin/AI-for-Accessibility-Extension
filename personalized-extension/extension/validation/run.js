// The validation run: what holds a task together across pages.
//
// A check fires on one page. A RUN is what makes the layer coherent — it
// remembers the contract, what has already been said, what the agent is
// waiting on, and what it never looked at. Without it every page is a fresh
// start, findings repeat, and a gate is just a printed sentence.
//
// This is the piece the harness agent talks to. It exposes three things:
//
//   observe(snapshot, phase)  read a page, check it, decide how hard to press
//   gate()                    is the agent allowed to continue?
//   answer(text)              resolve whatever it is waiting on
//
// The agent must call gate() before any step that commits something. That is
// what makes a stop a stop rather than narration — the corpus is explicit that
// noticing a problem and continuing anyway is worse than not noticing.
