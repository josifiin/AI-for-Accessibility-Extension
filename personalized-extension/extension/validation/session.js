// harness, which is why it hangs itself on globalThis rather than exporting.
//
// It does three things the pieces below it cannot do alone:
//
//   * reads the live page through the harness, not through the agent's account
//     of the page. That separation is the whole argument, so it must not be
//     possible to configure it away.
//   * holds the agent at a gate. A stop that the agent can step over is
//     narration; the corpus is explicit that noticing and continuing is worse
//     than not noticing.
//   * publishes to chrome.storage so the panel and the voice engine see the
//     same findings at the same time.
